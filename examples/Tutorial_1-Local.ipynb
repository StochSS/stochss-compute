    "# StochSS-Compute Tutorial\n",
    "This self-contained tutorial will show you how to use StochSS-Compute with the Python Dask API to run a simulation. Since it is self-contained, you should shut down any other StochSS-Compute servers or Dask clusters you may have running before beginning.  \n",
    "If you have ever used GillesPy2 to run simulations locally, you almost already know how to run remote simulations, as the syntax is nearly the same. Running a simulation remotely with GillesPy2 requires 3 components: a `Model()` (your data), a `Solver()` (SSA, TauHybrid, ODE, etc.), and a running instance of a `ComputeServer()`. If you do not wish to explicitly state the solver, one will be automatically chosen."
