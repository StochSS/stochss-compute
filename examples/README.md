Examples of using StochSS-Compute
===========================

The files in this directory are runnable Python examples of using [GillesPy2](https://github.com/gillesPy2/GillesPy2) to perform stochastic simulation on a StochSS-Compute instance.  In terms of biology, they are overly simplistic and do not capture the real-life complexity of the process being modeled &ndash; the aim is not biological realism but rather to illustrate basic usage of GillesPy2.

* [Tutorial 1](Tutorial_1-Local.ipynb) &ndash; a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) demonstrating the use of StochSS-Compute and GillesPy2 using the Dask Python API.

* [Tutorial 2](Tutorial_2-AWS.ipynb) &ndash; Shows how to run simulations by launching an EC2 instance.
