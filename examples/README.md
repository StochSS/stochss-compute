Examples of using StochSS-Compute
===========================

The files in this directory are runnable Python examples of using [GillesPy2](https://github.com/gillesPy2/GillesPy2) to perform stochastic simulation on a StochSS-Compute instance.  In terms of biology, they are overly simplistic and do not capture the real-life complexity of the process being modeled &ndash; the aim is not biological realism but rather to illustrate basic usage of [GillesPy2](https://github.com/gillesPy2/GillesPy2).

* [Start Here](StartHere.ipynb) &ndash; a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) demonstrating the use of StochSS-Compute and GillesPy2 on a simple Michaelis-Menten model

* [Tutorial 0](Tutorial0.ipynb) &ndash; a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) which offers a more thorough explaination of the StochSS-Compute client, server, and Dask.
